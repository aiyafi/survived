# survived

one repo.  
one commit every year.

this is my yearly checkpoint; a small reminder that no matter how weird, heavy, or chaotic the year was, i made it through.

## why
* because surviving counts.  
* because showing up still matters.  
* because being here is already an achievement.

see you next year, Fox.
